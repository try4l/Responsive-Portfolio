        <p>Hello, my name is Alan but my friends just call me occasionally. In the words of Jerry Garcia, "What a long, strange trip it's been." Sometimes I can't believe that in between playing my guitar and attending music festivals, I somehow found the time to enjoy a career as a medical device developer.</p>  
          
        <p>And during that time, I wore many hats in the technical world. I have been an electrical engineer, software engineer, program manager and a systems engineer. I have worked in many different groups from operations to  advanced development in different capacities from individual contributor to senior manager.</p>
            
        <p>One thing I have always enjoyed is the chance to work with new and interesting technologies. Starting  with some of the first microprocessors and working in assembly code(!) on the first IV infusion pumps. And then later with C and C++ on more complex distributed systems. Learning the Java language was also fun and I earned enough extension credit to qualify for the Java Certificate.</p>

        <p>Another thing I have always enjoyed is the chance to work with interesting people. Lately I have been learning all the web tech I can as fast as I can and I can't seem to get enough!</p>
